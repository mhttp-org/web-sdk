# portal-js
JavaScript client library for MHTTP

## Introduction to MHTTP

In the Metaverse, ensuring user rights to teleportation is fundamental to breaking down walled gardens and safeguarding an open and connected ecosystem.

MHTTP is an open standard for teleportation across the Metaverse. The protocol enables developers to create portals using an open JSON schema, and empowers users to teleport through these portals to destinations. 

While many different technologies exist as partial solutions, the world lacks a single technology that provides a coherent standard for metaverse teleportation. MHTTP builds upon existing technologies like HTTP, OAuth and JSON to provide developers an easy way to create portals and users a seamless way to teleport. Both developer simplicity and user accessibility are therefore key design goals.

## About Portal.js 
Portal.js is a JavaScript client library for MHTTP for Web VR/AR/XR and Web developers. Once this library is included in web-based metaverse environments, developers will be able to create portals using an open JSON schema, which will be published alongside Portal.js.

## Stayed Tuned - Release Date in early Q3, 2022
We have started an early reference implementation of MHTTP on GitHub as an open-source project under MIT license. We plan for an initial release in early Q3, 2022. Join our movement today - your contribution in usage, code, ideas or feedback is highly instrumental towards realizing an open and connected Metaverse together. 

## Early Technical Inspirations for Teleportation
- [HTTP](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/Specs.html) - the Web's most important protocol for navigating from one site to another that made the Web what it is today
- [Time Sharing of Computers and Context Switching](https://archive.org/details/large-fast-computers) - Christopher Strachey's original 1959 paper on how multiple applications can run on one computer at the same time and how to context switch between applications
- [Reminiscences on the Theory of Time-Sharing](http://jmc.stanford.edu/computing-science/timesharing.html) - John McCarthy reflects on Strachey's work and his own work on time-sharing
- [OAuth](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) - the de facto industry standard protocol for authorization and access delegation

## Cultural References in Teleportation
- [William Shakespeare's 'The Tempest'](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/tempest/full.html) - Ariel is a spirit in Shakespeare's 'The Tempest' (1610 - 1611), capable of weather control and teleportation
